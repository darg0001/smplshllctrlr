# smplshllctrlr
PHP Command Injection exploitation tool

1. Exploit web page and upload simple-shell.php (or simply find an existing exploitable command injection).
2. Execute the controller to exploit the command injection vulnerability.
   The controller is simply a command injection exploitation tool, and can therefore with a few adjustments be rewritten to exploit allready existing vulnerabilities without the need for uploading the 'simple-shell.php'.
